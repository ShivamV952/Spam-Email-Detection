# Spam Email Detection

## Introduction
In this project, I tackled the problem of detecting spam emails from a federated learning approach.

## Steps
Now that we have disucessed the reasons behind this project, we are going to talk about the steps I took in developing this project.

### Step 1: Data and Data Cleaning
The dataset I used is the Kaggle Simple Spam Filter. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohitr/simple-spam-filter/data).
After downloading the dataset, I took several steps to clean it and make it ready for training, all of such steps are evident in the [SED_FL_Data_Cleaning notebook].

### Step 2: Centralized BERT
BERT is a highly sophisticated languaged model that is used for various NLP tasks. My ultimate goal was to use this model ; hence, to get an idea of how to work with it and train it, I developed [SED_FL_Centralized_Bert_And_Naive_Bayes].

### Step 3: Naive Bayes Approach
There are several ways to classify a text, one of the most popular ones is Naive Bayes. The implementation of this approach can also be found.

## Results
As it is evident from the notebooks, the results of this approach were highly promising.
If you have any question, I would be delighted to answer you.
